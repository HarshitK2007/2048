Hello there, I know this lame code should not be added on github, but anyways who cares.
<br>
I am only adding to just use github as its mainstream for programmers and I wanna be one, yes thats it.
<br>
This is console based game which is known as 2048, I don't know whether its popular or not but I just created it to learn stuff.
<br>
This game ends when player either reaches 16,384 or there is no place left for 2 to be inserted and the scoring system only adds up the newly unlocked numbers only once, like 2, 4, 6, 8, 16....16384.
<br>
So yeah the maximum score can be 32766 and minimum can be 0 if you exit or 2.
